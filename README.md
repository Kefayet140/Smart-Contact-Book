# Smart-Contact-Book (Java OOP)
📌 Description
This Smart Contact Book is a console-based Java application designed to manage contacts effectively. It allows users to add, update, delete, search, and view contacts. Additionally, it organizes contacts, checks for duplicates, and saves the data for future access. This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.

🎯 Features
✅ Contact Management: Add, update, delete, and search contacts.

✅ Data Organization: Sort contacts by name and view them alphabetically.

✅ Data Integrity: Detects duplicate contacts and handles errors gracefully.

✅ File Management: Save and load contacts to and from a file for persistent storage.

🧠 OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation: Contact details are kept private and can only be accessed via getter and setter methods.
Inheritance: Used for creating different types of contacts (e.g., family, work).
Polymorphism: Method overloading and overriding are used to perform various operations on contacts with different parameters.
Abstraction: Hides complex logic like file handling and contact management, providing a simple interface for users.

🛠 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java
IDE: NetBeans
File Handling: Java File I/O for saving and loading contact data
Database: No external database is used; file system stores contact data
